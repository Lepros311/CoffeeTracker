# Coffee Tracker

The [Coffee Tracker](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/32/Coffee%20Tracker) project is the first project I've done that using Angular (aside from the Angular tutorial project). The app allows a user to record sales of different coffees. The coffee list is initially seeded from this [Coffee API](https://www.freepublicapis.com/coffee). This project is part of [The C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/) curriculum.

## Requirements

- [x] This is an application where you should record sales in a coffee shop.
- [x] You can choose a different type of shop, if you're not a coffee person.
- [x] You should create two projects: A.NET WebApi and an Angular app.
- [x] You should have a filter functionality, so users can select records per date.
- [x] Make sure validation is user-friendly so the users know exactly what's wrong with their input.

## Challenges

- [x] Add integration with a real coffee API.

## Running the App

In the terminal, navigate to the API folder (CoffeeTracker > CoffeeTracker) and execute the following:  
`dotnet run --urls "https://localhost:7205`

Then open a separate terminal and navigate to the frontend folder (CoffeeTracker > CoffeeTracker.Frontend) and execute the following:  
`ng serve`

In your web browser, go to http://localhost:4200
